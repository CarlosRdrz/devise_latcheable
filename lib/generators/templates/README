======================================
Sweet! Just two more steps to go:

1. Run rake db:migrate

2. Modify config/latch.yml
Write there your app id and your app secret codes

Latch is enabled by default in all instances.

If you want to use it optionaly, set 'always_enabled' to false on your latch.yml file
and set latch_enabled to true in the instance that should be checked against Latch
