======================================
Only two more steps to go:

1. Run rake db:migrate

2. Modify config/latch.yml
Paste your app id and your app secret code there

Latch is enabled by default in all instances.

If you want to use it only in certain instances, set 'always_enabled' to false
on your latch.yml file and set latch_enabled to true in the instance
that should be checked against Latch
